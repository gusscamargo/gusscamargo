### About Me
I am Gustavo Michels de Camargo, a Computer Science undergraduate at the State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC). Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a passion for Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing, and Industrial Development, areas in which I have worked as a scholarship holder. My practical experience is accentuated by significant projects to which I have had the opportunity to contribute, such as the 'Spark Eyes System' in collaboration with General Motors, SENAI, and Strokmatic, where I developed computer vision software for automated inspection of welding points in the automotive industry. My journey has also led me to contribute to the field of computer vision through the development of the SKM-GenICam Library, an industrial camera management system, and through contributions to the open-source imageproc project, where I implemented features for Laplacian edge detection. In addition, I have worked on projects with Strokmatic for Usiminas and Santista, developing data collection systems for training artificial neural networks. My tech stack includes languages such as C, C++, Python, Rust, and TypeScript, and technologies like Docker, Redis, and Postgres. Beyond my professional interest, I am an avid reader with a particular love for history, classical literature, philosophy, and psychology. I am always looking to expand my knowledge and apply my skills in challenging and innovative projects that have a real impact on the industry and community.
