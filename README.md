### About Me
I am Gustavo Michels de Camargo, a Computer Science undergraduate at the State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC). My academic and professional journey has ignited a passion for Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing, Blockchain technology, and Industrial Development. Currently, I am working as a Blockchain researcher in a partnership between UDESC and the tax consultancy firm Becomex.

My practical experience is highlighted by significant projects such as the "Spark Eyes System," developed in collaboration with General Motors, SENAI, and Strokmatic, where I created computer vision software for the automated inspection of welding points in the automotive industry. I have also contributed to the field of computer vision through the development of the SKM-GenICam Library, an industrial camera management system, and by implementing Laplacian edge detection features in the open-source imageproc project.

In addition, I have worked on projects with Strokmatic for companies like Usiminas and Santista, developing data collection systems for training artificial neural networks. My tech stack includes languages such as C, C++, Python, Rust, and TypeScript, and technologies like Docker, Redis, and PostgreSQL.

Beyond my professional interests, I am an avid reader with a deep appreciation for history, classical literature, philosophy, and psychology. I am always seeking to expand my knowledge and apply my skills in challenging and innovative projects that have a real impact on the industry and community.
